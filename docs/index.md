---

Welcome to the Co-op Cloud technical documentation. This documentation is primarily meant for co-operatives and other democratic tech collectives already doing libre software hosting who are interested in the project and thinking about doing some early-adopter testing.

- If you're already familiar with the project and want to dive in, then head over to the [getting started guide](/overview/).

- If you want to see what applications are already available, then check out the [app catalogue](/apps/).

- If you're new and trying to understand more about the project, then please see [the FAQ](/faq/).

- If you want to learn more about the goals and background of the project, then please see the [strategy](/strategy) page.

!!! danger "Here be dragons"

    This project is still [alpha quality software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Alpha). Please take that into consideration if you are thinking about using this system in production. We're working hard to make Co-op Cloud stable. In the meantime, this is a good time to help us out with initial testing, feedback, ideas or [join in with development](/contribute/).

!!! note "Looking for managed Co-op Cloud hosting?"

    If you're looking for a co-operative or tech collective to host digital services for you using the Co-op Cloud, then please see [the managed hosting](/managed/) page for more.
