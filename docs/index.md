Welcome to the Co-op Cloud technical documentation. This documentation is primarily meant for co-operatives and other democratic tech collectives already doing libre software hosting who are interested in the project and thinking about doing some early-adopter testing.

    This project is still [alpha quality software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Alpha). Please take that into consideration if you are thinking about using this system in production. We're working hard to make Co-op Cloud stable. In the meantime, this is a good time to help us out with initial testing, feedback, ideas or [join in with development](/contribute/).
