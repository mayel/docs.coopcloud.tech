## Definitions

CoCl is a **philosophy**.

 - .. to get started, you create a **server**, e.g. a new Hetzner VPS, including
   your local configuration to connect to it.
 - .. then you install an **app** like wordpress or nextcloud, which is made up of multiple **services**
 - .. and configure your app.
