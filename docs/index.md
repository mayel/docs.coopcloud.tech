Welcome to the Co-op Cloud technical documentation. This documentation is primarily meant for cooperatives and other small service providers already doing free software hosting who are interested in the project and thinking about doing some early-adopter testing.

    This project is still [alpha quality software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Alpha). Please take that into consideration if you are thinking about using this system in production. We're working hard to make Co-op Cloud stable. In the meantime, this is a good time to help us out with initial testing, feedback, ideas or [join in with development](/contribute/).
