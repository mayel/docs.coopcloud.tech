title: A Cooperative Alternative
---

The Cooperative Cloud is a platform built by and for worked-owned technology
cooperatives which proposes a shared social and technical infrastructure for
the operation and management of free software applications. The project was
initiated by [Autonomic].

The project arose out of the understanding that technology cooperatives
continue to struggle to deliver free software solutions without relying on
monopolies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon for technical infrastructure.
The contradictions of working with abusive and extractive forces brings the
idea of offering an alternative into question.

[The technological crisis is a social crisis] and therefore building an
alternative digital future cannot be done without broad and meaningful
cooperation. The Cooperative Cloud project takes as its starting point, the
independent free software community standards, tools, approaches and governance
methods which cooperatives can make use of as part of offering a real
alternative.
