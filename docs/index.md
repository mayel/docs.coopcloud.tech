Welcome to the Co-op Cloud technical documentation. This documentation is primarily meant for cooperatives and other small service providers already doing free software hosting who are interested in the project and thinking about doing some early-adopter testing.

## Getting started

If you're new to the project, then head over to the [getting started guide](/overview/).

## Apps

If you want to see what applications are already available, then check out the [app catalogue](/apps/).

## FAQ

If you're trying to understand more about the project, then please see [the FAQ](/faq/).

## Important Note

This project is still alpha quality software. Please take that into consideration before using in production. We're working hard to make Co-op Cloud stable. In the meantime, this is a good time to help us out with initial testing, feedback, ideas or join in with development.
