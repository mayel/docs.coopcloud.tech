title: A Cooperative Alternative
---

Welcome to the Cooperative Cloud technical documentation! This documentation is
primarily meant for cooperatives and other small service providers already
doing free software hosting who are interested in the project and thinking
about doing some early-adopter testing.

- If you're new to the project, then head over to the [getting started
  guide](/overview/)

- If you want to see what applications are already available, then check the
  [application catalogue](/apps/)

- If you're trying to understand more about the project please see [the
  FAQ](/faq/)

!!! note

    This project is still alpha quality software! Please take that into
    consideration if deciding to use for anything that end-users may rely on.
    We're working hard to make it stable. In the meantime, this is a good time
    to help us out with initial testing, feedback and ideas! The more the
    merrier.
