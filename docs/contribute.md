title: Contributing guide
---

The project is really young so we don't have contribution guides setup yet.

The best thing to do is [drop us a line](/contact/) and we can work from there.

Some handy links in the meantime:

- [`abra` command-line tool repository](https://git.autonomic.zone/coop-cloud/abra)
- [docs.cloud.autonomic.zone source repository](https://git.autonomic.zone/coop-cloud/docs.cloud.autonomic.zone)
- [App catalogue repositories](https://git.autonomic.zone/coop-cloud)
- [Public roadmap repository and milestones](https://git.autonomic.zone/coop-cloud/organising/issues)

!!! note

    Please note, our [git.autonomic.zone](https://git.autonomic.zone) instance
    is currently set to "invite only" mode for `$reasons`. We mirror all repositories on Github
    under [github.com/Autonomic-Cooperative](https://github.com/Autonomic-Cooperative) and will
    respond to issues and pull requests there.
