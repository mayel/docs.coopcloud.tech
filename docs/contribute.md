title: Contributing guide
---

The project is really young so we don't have contribution guides setup yet.

The best thing to do is [drop us a line](/contact/) and we can work from there.

Some handy links in the meantime:

- [`abra` command-line tool repository](https://git.autonomic.zone/coop-cloud/abra) (mirrored to Github [here](https://github.com/Autonomic-Cooperative/abra))
- [docs.cloud.autonomic.zone source repository](https://git.autonomic.zone/coop-cloud/docs.cloud.autonomic.zone) (mirrored to Github [here](https://github.com/Autonomic-Cooperative/docs.cloud.autonomic.zone))
- [App catalogue repositories](https://git.autonomic.zone/coop-cloud)
- [Public roadmap repository and milestones](https://git.autonomic.zone/coop-cloud/organising/issues)

!!! note

    We do not have public logins enabled on the Autonomic
    [git.autonomic.zone](https://git.autonomic.zone) Gitea instance because we
    haven't needed to open it up yet for public contributions. However, we want
    to get around to that soon. Please nag us via our [public
    channels](/contact/) and we'll get to it.
