## Kite Flying Hours

The "Kite Flying Hour" is a weekly public moment where anyone can "drop by" into a Jitsi call and ask/do/propose whatever and meet some people who are currently working on the project. We haven't worked it all out but our process for now is the following:

- Someone from Autonomic will volunteer to be present and talk about the project for an hour weekly from 15:00 CEST - 16:00 CEST
- We announce the hour via our socials
    - [ ] A pinned toot on [`@coopcloud@social.coop`](https://social.coop/@coopcloud)
    - [ ] A pinned tweet on [`@Coop_Cloud`](https://twitter.com/Coop_Cloud)
    - [ ] A post to the `#coopcloud:autonomic.zone` room

Here is some invitation boilerplate which you can use:

> Hey folks, you're all warmly invited to the Co-op Cloud Kite Flying Hour at `$X_TIME` `$Y_TZ` `$Z_DATE` over in [meet.jit.si/CoopCloudKiteFlyingHour](https://meet.jit.si/CoopCloudKiteFlyingHour)!
>
> Inspired by exquisite childhood memories of [flying kites, eating popsicles and looking at clouds](https://norwichhistory.org/norwich-a-z-j-is-for-jigsaw/), it's an open hour to come hang out online and discuss/co-work/lurk/etc. around the [Co-op Cloud](https://coopcloud.tech/) project.
>
> There are no "stupid questions"! It's a space to inquire, be curiousm have a good time and get to know each other.
>
> We take notes and doodle on [this collaboratively editable pad](https://pad.autonomic.zone/LqotfSJJRj69RcTtWmr7iw). If you don't have time to attend, feel free to drop your questions and some contact details also, so we can get in touch. This is only the first Kite Flying Hour in a recurring series of Kite Flying Hours.
