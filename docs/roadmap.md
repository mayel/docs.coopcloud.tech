!!! note

    We do not have public logins enabled on the Autonomic
    [git.autonomic.zone](https://git.autonomic.zone) Gitea instance because we
    haven't needed to open it up yet for public contributions. However, we want
    to get around to that soon. Please nag us via our [public
    channels](/contact/) and we'll get to it.
