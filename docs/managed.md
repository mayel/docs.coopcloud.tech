The Co-op Cloud is still [alpha quality software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Alpha) but you can still work with a co-operative or tech collective to host some part or all of your online digital services with it. Organisations who want to support the project can get in touch with Co-op Cloud service providers via the following list for a quote on what they're looking for and how much it will cost. Service providers can then factor in some percentage of the cost to co-fund the development of this project.

    If you're a co-operative or a tech collective who wants to appear on this list, please [get in touch](/contact/)! We want to expand the number of service providers using the Co-op Cloud so that project is more widely available to end-users and organisations who can influence the direction and co-fund the development.
