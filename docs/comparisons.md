# "This is foolishness, what about ...?"

 - Kubernetes
     - 👍 Helm charts are available for some key apps already
     - 👎 too big -- requires 3rd party tools to run a single-node instance
 - Bitnami stacks
 - Cloudron
     - 👍 Lovely web interface for app, domain & user management
     - 👍 Bigger library of apps
     - 👍 Built-in SSO using LDAP, which is compatible with more apps and often has a better user interface than OAuth
     - 👍 Most apps are actively maintained by the Cloudron team
     - 👎 Moving away from open source. Free version has a 1-app limit
     - 👎 Based on Docker images, not stacks, so multi-process apps (e.g. parsoid for Mediawiki) are a non-starter
     - 👎 Difficult to extend apps
     - 👎 Only supported on Ubuntu
     - 👎 Upstreams aren't involved
 - Yunohost
     - 👍 Lovely web interface for app, domain & user management
     - 👍 Bigger library of apps
     - 👍 Awesome backup / deploy / restore continuous integration testing
     - 👍 Supports hosting apps in subdirectories as well as subdomains
     - 👍 Doesn't require a public-facing IP
     - 👎 Upstreams aren't involved
     - 👎 Not idempotent: uninstalling apps leaves growing cruft
 - Ansible
     - 👍 Includes server creation and bootstrapping
     - 👎 Upstreams aren't publishing Ansible roles
     - 👎 Lots of manual work involved in things like app isolation, backups, updates
 - `docker-compose`
     - 👎 Manual work required for process monitoring 
     - 👎 Secret storage not available yet
     - 👎 [Not recommended](https://github.com/BretFisher/ama/issues/8)
 - Manually installing apps
     - 👍 Simple - just follow upstream instructions to install and update
     - 👎 Loads of manual work required for app isolation and backups
     - 👎 Array of sysadmin skills required to install apps
     - 👎 Hard to share configs into the commons
